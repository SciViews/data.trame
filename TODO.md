# data.trame To Do list

-   `print()` method should indicate if there are rownames
-   Check `[<-`, `[[`, `[[<-` and `$<-` and compare data.table vs tibble (for now, it is the data.tables methods that are used)
-   Indicate keys for `str()`
-   `transpose_()` that is data.trame-aware
-   `merge()`, `rollup()`, `cube()` and `groupinsets()`
-   check `split()`
-   Implement the tibble methods like `bind_cols()` and `bind_rows()`
-   Implement the _ functions similar to dplyr and tidyr.
-   Code for playing nicely with S4 objects for data.trame, including `cbind2()` and `rbind2()`
