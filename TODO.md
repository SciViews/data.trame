# data.trame To Do list

-   Implement the _ functions similar to dplyr and tidyr.
-   Problem with the. header for `print()`
-   Indicate keys for `str()`
-   Refactor `[` to use `NextMethod()` instead of `do.call()`
-   Check `[<-`, `[[`, `[[<-` and `$<-` and compare data.table vs tibble (for now, it is the data.tables methods that are used)
