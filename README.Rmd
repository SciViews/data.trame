**data.trame** is an hybrid **data.table** - **tibble** - **data.frame** object for the SciViews::R dialect. It enhances **data.frame** with the speed of **data.table** and the nice features of **tibble** (stricter syntax, pretty printing...)

## Installation

{data.trame} is not available from CRAN yet. You should install it from the [SciViews R-Universe](https://sciviews.r-universe.dev). To install this package and its dependencies, run the following command in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('data.trame', repos = c('https://sciviews.r-universe.dev',
  'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

You can also install the latest development version. Make sure you have the {remotes} R package installed:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

Use `install_github()` to install the {data.trame} package from GitHub (source from **main** branch will be recompiled on your machine):

``` r
remotes::install_github("SciViews/data.trame")
```

R should install all required dependencies automatically, and then it should compile and install {data.trame}.


## Further explore {data.trame}
